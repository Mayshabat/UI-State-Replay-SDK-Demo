# UI State Replay SDK

UI State Replay SDK is an Android SDK that allows developers to **record, store, and replay user interface interactions** without video recording.

The SDK captures structured UI events (navigation, clicks, screen changes), uploads them to a backend API, and enables deterministic replay for debugging, UX analysis, and bug reproduction.
